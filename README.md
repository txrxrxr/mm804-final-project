<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Data Visualization of COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage in Canada
Data Visualization of COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage in Canada

This project focuses on the questions of interest:
* What is the number of populations that have received only one dose (per province and per month)? 
* We built a data visualization project to visualize the COVID-19 vacci-nation coverage across each province in Canada. 
* What is the comparison of vaccination coverage between two provinces (per month)?
* We built a data visualization project to visualize the COVID-19 vacci-nation coverage across each province in Canada based on Django and React. 

### Built With and Dataset 
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Dataset: National vaccination coverage](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/)
* To be noticed, the dataset is commited in the source control, you will find the "db.sqlite3" file under the root folder after clone the repo

### Prerequisites
```sh
Clone the repo (the dataset "db.sqlite3" file can be found under the root folder after clone the repo)
$ cd data_visualization/mysite
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Migrate and Run the back-end Server
```
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver
```

### Start front-end client page
```
$ cd my-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Interact with the data visualization system in your browser
```
- Check the vaccine coverage from the perspective of population taking 1 does and population taking 2 doses for one province in a specific month:

```
- Compare the vaccine coverages between two provinces in a specific month:
```
![1](https://github.com/txrxrxr/data_visualization/blob/master/mysite/my-app/public/pic2.png) 

```
- Display the detail of the dataset (http://localhost:3000/detail):
